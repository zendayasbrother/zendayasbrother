**Hi there, my name's Daniel Onyeakazi: a UK based content creator and CS student (he/him)**

Get to know me better with these tidbits: 

- 💻 I specialise in Java currently in university, and have foundational knowledge in Python + SQL, and C# 
- 👀 My interests are: the creator economy, game theory and data science
- ⚙️ I've been creating relatable content for three years, hoping to pivot to more substantial + vulnerable content
- 🫱🏻‍🫲🏾 I am looking to secure intership in fields that utilise quantitative, analytical and communication skills (data, marketing, etc)

- ⚡ Fun facts: My favourite media genre is science fiction (love to the Matrix triology) and I wanted to do CS solely because of an accessibile app idea
